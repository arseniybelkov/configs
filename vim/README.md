## Installation


In order to install vim configs, run the following code in your terminal.  
This will generate ```~/._vim_old_``` folder with your previous configs.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arseniybelkov/configs.git
./configs/vim/install.sh  
```  

In order to remove the config, run:  
``` bash
./configs/vim/uninstall.sh  
```
